# DestinyCollections
A list of all the collection items in Destiny 2, grabbed from the bungie.net API


## How to use
* Open Lookup.py
* Change the ```itemName``` variable to the name of the item you want to lookup
* Run the file
* Open up ```itemInfo.json``` to see the API info of the item

## How to recompile the JSON
Run the ```compile.py``` file and leave it sit for a while<br>
This code isnt very efficient, as it iterates through items that have already been saved in the dictionary.
